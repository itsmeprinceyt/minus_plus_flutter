# Minus Plus Counter

**Minus Plus Counter** is a beautifully simple Flutter-based tally app designed for quick counting with persistent local storage and smart number formatting.

Tap **+** to increment, **−** to decrement, and your count is automatically saved.  
Large numbers are intelligently formatted (K, M, B, etc.) while still showing the exact value.
